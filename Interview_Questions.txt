Interviewer: "How do you prevent overfitting?"
You: "I use walk-forward optimization with 2-year training 
      and 6-month test windows. Average train Sharpe is 0.58, 
      test Sharpe is 0.42, so only 28% degradation. Parameters 
      are 75% stable across windows, suggesting robust strategy."
